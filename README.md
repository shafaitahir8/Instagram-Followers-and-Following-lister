# Instagram-Followers-and-Following-lister
Use it to gather a dataframe containing a list of followers and following of an instagram user, You can only gather from public accounts and accounts that you follow. We can then use this data to whatever purpose.

# Problems
- You need to open the automated browser that launches when you run the program so it can click where it needs to
- It will throw an error if the account to be scraped is private or not accessible


# What Enhancements can make this better?
- A user interface for easier interaction 
- More easier way to scroll, This program uses clicks to scroll the list of followers so instagram loads more. The problem is we cannot use the computer while its scrolling since the mouse pointer is busy doing clicks 
- More insights on the gathered data
